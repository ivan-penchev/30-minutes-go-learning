# Presenting the idea

The weekly series, '30 Minutes of Go Learning,' is designed to introduce the Golang programming language to professionals of any experience level, with the specific goal of fitting the content within a 30-minute timeframe.

It would be split intro three tracks, to account for the individual learning needs. Ideally the outcome of this action would be that everyone is engaged, from a coding novice, senior developers in languages, to strong go engineers.

The tracks would be:

- A. Language Track
- B. Architecture Track
- C. Real World Track
