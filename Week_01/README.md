## 1. Welcome

### Intro

Thank you for joining!

- We're here today to learn how to build fast, reliable, and efficient software at scale in a practical and useful way
- This started out as a simple idea for a limited audience
- In the group there will be coding novices, senior developers in languages, and also strong go engineers
- The goal is to try to keep everyone engaged; And homework is key


## 2. Learning path structure

The learning path is split into three tracks

- A. Language Track
- B. Architecture Track
- C. Real World Track

Today we are covering

- A. Language Track: hello world, variables, constants, values, structs and pointers
- B. Architecture Track: Domain driven design with Go
- C. Real World Track: HTTP Client and Server

## 3. Tell me more about Go

| **What is Go**                                    | **What Go is not**                              |
|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| - Go is an open source programming language supported by Google | - No bytecode interpreter (just a compiled binary) |
| - The main language site is [go.dev](https://go.dev/) | - No container O/S required (deploy in scratch / distroless docker images) |
| - It is easy to learn and get started with built-in concurrency and a robust standard library | - No frameworks (generally frowned upon by the wider Go community) |
| - Go engineers like simplicity; there are only 25 keywords | - No object orientation (there are overlapping concepts but a degree of unlearning will be required for some) |
| - Go code tends not to be tight - duplication and templating are valid approaches | - No try/catch error handling |
| - There is a growing ecosystem of partners, communities, and tools | - No manual memory management (garbage collection is automatic) |
| - Go is the language of opensource (kubernetes, etcd, prometheus, influxdb, ...) |                                                    |
| - Prevalent in modern tech companies like Netflix and Uber |                                                    |
